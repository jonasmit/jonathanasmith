Howdy! My name is Jonathan (Jon) Smith. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the technology industry.

This is my personal blog and, of course, all thoughts are my own. I hope to capture my thoughts and experiences on a variety of topics including - Technology, Music, Sports, Travel, and San Francisco (my adopted city).
