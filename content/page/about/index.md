My name is Jonathan Smith and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work at VMware (having arrived via the [Heptio](https://www.heptio.com/ "Heptio's Homepage") acquisition in 2018). I focus primarily on Cloud Native Applications and Kubernetes. I have spent a lot of time in the technology space working on building teams, organizations and products.

This is my personal blog and all opinions are my own.
