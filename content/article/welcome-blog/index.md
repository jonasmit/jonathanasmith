After over 20 years in the technology industry, I have had the good fortune to work with some truly amazing colleagues, excellent customers, and inspiring leaders. Each day I meet with customers who are building inspired businesses and solving some of the most complex and interesting business and technology challenges in the world.

My current focus is working with organizations who are leveraging Cloud-native architectures to build the next generation solutions.
